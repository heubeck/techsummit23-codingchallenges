# #1 Rockstar Anagram

## Specification

Write a program that reads two words from user input and prints "true" if they are anagrams, i.e. contain the exact same letters (case insensitive), in the Rockstar programming language (https://github.com/RockstarLang).

Words considered anagrams:
```
foo/foo
foo/Foo
foo/oof
foobar/barfoo
Tom Vorlost Riddle/ist Lord Voldemort
```
(sorry for any spoilers)

Words not considered anagrams:
```
foo/bar
foo/of
foo/foobar
```

## Scoring

Solutions will be judged based on function (of course it should work) and the use of idiomatic Rockstar language with references to MediaMarktSaturn. Winner will be the working solution with the most literally valuabe lyrics, praising MMS Technology.
