## Implementation

Therefore please solely write to the `<style` and `<div class="logo">` elements in the [challenge.html](challenge.html) file.

You're free to use any CSS magic (apart from including, pixel mapping or vectorizing the original image of course), but the only permitted html element are `div`s inside the `div.logo` container.

## Scoring

All solutions will be assessed by how close they look like the MMS Tech logo.
The `challenge.html` file will be rendered using Google Chrome and Firefox, the better looking one will be scored.
