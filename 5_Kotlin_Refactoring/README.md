# #5 Kotlin Refactoring

## Specification

The task is to refactor the functions in [Main.kt](./src/main/kotlin/com/mediamarktsaturn/techsummit23/Main.kt) to incorporate more [Kotlin idioms](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html).

## Implementation

Please implement your solution by only changing the [Main.kt](./src/main/kotlin/com/mediamarktsaturn/techsummit23/Main.kt) file.

You can add more functions if you deem necessary but please **do not rename** the existing ones.

For testing your solution, use the following command

```shell
# Change directory to this challenge
cd 5_Kotlin_Refactoring

# Run test cases
./gradlew test
```

There is also a GitHub workflow (named: `Verify #5 Kotlin Refactoring`), which will run on each push and verify the test cases.

## Scoring

Solutions will be judged, based on

1. Tests are green
1. The use of Kotlin idioms
1. Readability of the refactored codes
